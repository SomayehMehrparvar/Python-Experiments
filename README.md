# Python-Experiments
# Hands-On Assignment #1

This repository contains my work for *Applied Data Science I*. It showcases my progress in learning Python, Jupyter, and data science concepts.

## Plan

I will complete all assignments and projects using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, documenting my process clearly so others can follow along. I plan to practice regularly, seek feedback, and steadily improve my skills.
